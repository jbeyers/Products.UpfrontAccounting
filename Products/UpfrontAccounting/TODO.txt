* I removed the BalanceSheetSection and IncomeStatementSection fields
from Account since these really belong on a configuration object.

* Consider using a composite key with the date and transaction id for
sorting transactions and transaction entries.

* Icons for content types

* It would be quite clever if the "Closing Transfers" form default to
the next closing date automatically. If the last closing was on 28 Feb
2006 then it should simply default to the end of Feb the next year.

* Better error handling when importing CSV files eg. if reference cannot be
found then it must be reported.

* When importing, only show columns that match the schema. I did not
notice for instance that my CSV file had a column titled
TaxIncludedInCashbookEntries where the field id in the schema was
TaxIncludedInCashBookEntries.

* CreditNoteDate should be renamed to effectiveDate

* use plone.folder for CashBookEntryFolder

* use permissions consistently in security declarations.

* when objects are deleted from an OrderedBTreeContainer they are not
automatically removed from _positionIds map. Currently _delete is called
by CashBookEntryFolder in removeEntryBalance.

* remove getEntriesLastAccount, prevBalance, nextBalance, etc.

* refactor all unit tests to use assertEqual instead of failUnless

* use javascript check to guard against navigating away from form when
importing files.

* Set Default Sales, Sales Tax and Retained Income accounts.

* Select Logo on Add form

* Default Account Name to Organisation Name

* Account Opened on, default to today. Strip away Time fields.

* Auto generate account number.

* Add/edit/post transaction in list view.

* Reverse transaction does not copy title.

* Show value in base currency on invoice AND invoice listing.

* Ugly Title for invoice templates.

* Bug on adding item to invoice template.

* Export CSV on transactions gives error.

* Automatic fetch new exchange rates.
  Found the following sites/services:
  - http://www.exchangerate-api.com/python
  - http://www.exchangerate-api.com/supported-currencies
  - http://www.xignite.com
  - http://www.oanda.com/currency-data/
  - http://www.xe.com
  Technical suggestion:
  - Create a facade for a selection of exchange rate web services.
  - Basic API: 
    get_exchange_rate?from=[from currency]&to=[to currency]&amount=[amount]
    get_all_exchange_rates
  - Results are persisted for 24 hours?

* Get accounts on some of the other accounting systems in order to evaluate them.
