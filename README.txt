Introduction
============

    NOTE: The version imported into Github is being migrated to Plone 4. To
    help with the migration use the buildout located here:

        https://github.com/rochecompaan/upfrontaccounting.buildout

Upfront Accounting is a fully functional accounting system for Plone. It
is in production at Upfront Systems and a few small companies that are
involved with Upfront Systems. Earlier versions have been in use for
almost 5 years.

It has a General Ledger, Accounts Receivable, Accounts Payable and
supports multiple cashbooks. AJAX interfaces exist for the creation and
editing of invoices, invoice templates, bank statement imports and
cashbook entries. It is lacking on the reporting side.

At this stage, we are happy that the foundation for a full featured
accounting system has been laid and the next steps are to focus on
reporting and the development of a more coherent user interface that
does not rely so much on Plone UI.
